Welcome to my honors project for Fall 2014. My name is Kurt Engsig and I go to school at Carleton University.

Running Instructions:

This system was created using QTCreator, so when compiling you will have to link in the appropriate libraries if you are not using QTCreator. You must first generate the object files, executables, and if not using the provided database.db3 database, you must create that as well using sqlite3. Once all these files are generated, the database.db3 file must be in the same directory as the Server executable.

It is a work in progress so there is very little functionality.
